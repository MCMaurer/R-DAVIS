Chunks, arguments to chunks
Markdown formatting (just look at the cheatsheet!!)
How to write equations (google “how to write XYZ in latex”)
Inserting photos
Inserting weblinks
Inserting tables (kable, htmltable?)
Plot_ly as a finishing topic

## Visualize & Communicate

If we consider the data science workflow we showed earlier, we've covered most of the steps, save the last few. The excellent [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html) online book by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham gives a nice run down of the various pieces that the last two steps may entail (**Visualization** and **Communication**). We'll use some examples from that book, along with some of additional code you may recognize from previous lessons.

## R Markdown

RMarkdown is an excellent tool that is built into RStudio. It provides many options and is a very flexible and powerful platform for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents, using the Markdown language. RStudio has some excellent resources for this, be sure to visit their site: <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can use RMarkdown as a digital notebook of all you've done or the code you've used, or you can write a more formal report that summarizes a project or experiment. This lesson won't cover everything (not even close!), but it should introduce you to some of the possibilities, and get you comfortable using RMarkdown inside RStudio.

### *Knitting?*

When you open a new `.Rmd` document, you'll get a basic template with some demo text and code. If you look for the **Knit** button at the top of the document, and click the small arrow just to the right of that button, you'll see a number of options for generating different document formats.

Just to the right of the **Knit** button, there's a gear wheel with a small arrow to the right. Click on the small arrow and notice the various output options...these help determine where your content will end up when you **Knit**, or run chunks of code in your Rmd. We can play with these and determine what is most preferable.

## Rmarkdown Components

### Code Chunks

Let's take a look at the [example Rmarkdown file](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#r-markdown-basics) from **R for Data Science**:
